Clone of stronglifts app with added functionality

# Git Workflow (for Chris)
1. Checkout main branch
`git checkout main`
2. Branch from main
`git checkout -b <name>/<feature>`
`git checkout -b victor/settings-page`
3. Push new branch to the repo using the cloud icon (w/ upward arrow inside) in the bottom left of your screen (in VS code)
4. Once the feature is ready, make a pull request inside github. Assign either me or izu to review the code. Don't merge major changes without 1 reviewers approval.

# Git advise
1. Use meaningful commit names
2. Make the commits small and frequent. That way, if something breaks and we have to rollback, less work/code is lost.
